<td>
My name is Rafid Butt. I'm a full time student at Centennial College and currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Technology program. I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. <br>
The high school I attended was Lester B Pearson Collegiate Institute. <br>
I like to play video games and sports. I enjoy coding and learning different databases. Web application development is fun and my strong suit because html code is easy and efficient.
